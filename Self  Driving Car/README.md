# Self-Driving Car Simulation

## Overview
Simulates a self-driving car using computer vision and AI. OpenCV processes video frames for lane detection, object detection, and collision avoidance in real-time.

## Features
- Lane detection and following  
- Obstacle identification  
- Collision avoidance  
- Real-time video frame analysis

## Requirements
Python 3.x, OpenCV, NumPy  
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
